# WP Nested Pages


## Overview

Coming soon. **WP Nested Pages** - a more intuitive way to manage pages in the Wordpress admin. Drag and Drop interface allows quick reordering and nesting of pages, while maintaining the quick edit functionality you're accustomed to. 

Inspired by the popular [Structure module](http://wpduel.com/) for Expression Engine.
